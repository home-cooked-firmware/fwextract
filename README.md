# fwextract
Firmware extraction scripts for Anbernic devices

## Overview
`fwextract` is a script to extract the bootloader, kernel, and other resources from stock Anbernic firmware images.

Right now only firmware for Anbernic devices with the Allwinner H700 SoC is supported.

## Usage
_Coming soon._

### Running with Docker
We recommend using the `fwextract` Docker image to run `fwextract`. It includes all of the dependencies needed to run the firmware extraction script, and includes the underlying utils like `unpackbootimg` and `OpenixCard`.

### Running locally
_Coming soon._
